This is the basic outline of how you could build an app that takes voice prompts,
converts them to text using the Whisper API, generates responses with the ChatGPT API,
converts the responses back to audio using TTS, and plays them back to the user.
Depending on your specific requirements and platform, you would need to implement the 
app logic and user interface using appropriate programming languages, frameworks, and libraries.
